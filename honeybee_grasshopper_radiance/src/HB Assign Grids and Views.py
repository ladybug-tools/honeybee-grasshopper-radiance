"""
Add radiance Sensor Grids and/or Views to a Honeybee Model.
_
This assignment is necessary for any Radiance study, though whether a grid or a
view is required for a particular type of study is depenednet upon the recipe
used.

-

    Args:
        _model: A Honeybee Model to which the inpit grids_ and views_ will be assigned.
        grids_: A list of Honeybee-Radiance SensorGrids, which will be assigned to
            the input _model.
        views_: A list of Honeybee-Radiance Views, which will be assigned to the
            input _model.

    Returns:
        model: The input Honeybee Model with the grids_ and views_ assigned to it.
