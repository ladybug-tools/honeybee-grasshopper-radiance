"""
Generate electric lighting schedules from annual daylight results, which can be
used to account for daylight controls in energy simulations.
_
Such controls will dim the lights in the energy simulation according to whether
the illuminance values at the sensor locations are at a target illuminance setpoint.
_
In addition to benefiting from the accuracy of Radiance, using this component has
several advantages over the "HB Apply Daylight Control" component under HB-Energy.
Notably, it can account for setups with multiple illuminance sensors.
_
This component expects the annual daylight simulation to be run with one sensor
grid per room in the model. If the sensor grids within the annual daylight
simulation are distrbuted over the entire floor of each room, the resulting
schedules will be idealized, where light dimming has been optimized to supply
the minimum illuminance setpoint everywhere in the room. Grids with one, two,
or more sensors can be used to model setups where fractions of each room are
controlled by different sensors.
-

    Args:
        _results: An list of annual Radiance result files from the "HB Annual Daylight"
            component (containing the .ill files and the sun-up-hours.txt).
            This can also be just the path to the folder containing these
            result files.
        _base_schedule_: A lighting schedule representing the usage of lights without
            any daylight controls. The values of this schedule will be multiplied
            by the hourly dimming fraction to yield the output lighting schedules.
            The format of this schedule can be a Ladybug Data Collection, a HB-Energy
            schedule object, or the identifier of a schedule in the HB-Energy
            schedule library. If None, a schedule from 9AM to 5PM on weekdays
            will be used.
        _ill_setpoint_: A number for the illuminance setpoint in lux beyond which
            electric lights are dimmed if there is sufficient daylight.
            Some common setpoints are listed below. (Default: 300 lux).
            -
            50 lux - Corridors and hallways.
            150 lux - Computer work spaces (screens provide illumination).
            300 lux - Paper work spaces (reading from surfaces that need illumination).
            500 lux - Retail spaces or museums illuminating merchandise/artifacts.
            1000 lux - Operating rooms and workshops where light is needed for safety.

        _min_power_in_: A number between 0 and 1 for the the lowest power the lighting
            system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum
            input power. (Default: 0.3).
        _min_light_out_: A number between 0 and 1 the lowest lighting output the lighting
            system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum light
            output. Note that setting this to 1 means lights aren't dimmed at
            all until the illuminance setpoint is reached. This can be used to
            approximate manual light-switching behaviour when used in conjunction
            with the off_at_min_ output below. (Default: 0.2).
        off_at_min_: Boolean to note whether lights should switch off completely when
            they get to the minimum power input. (Default: False).

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        rooms: The input Rooms with simple daylight controls assigned to them.
