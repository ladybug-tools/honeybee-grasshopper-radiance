Create a State object representing a single dynamic group state.
-

    Args:
        modifier_: A Honeybee Radiance Modifier object to be applied to this state's
            parent in this state. This is used to swap out the modifier in
            multi-phase studies. If None, it will be the parent's default modifier.
        shades_: An optional array of StateGeometry objects to be included
            with this state.
    
    Returns:
        state: A Honeybee State object representing a single dynamic group state.
            This can be assigned to apertures or shades using the "HB Dynamic
            Aperture Group" componet or the "HB Dynamic Shade Group" component.
