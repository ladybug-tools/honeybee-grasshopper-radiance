"""
Create a list of exterior subface (apertures + doors) modifiers that can be
used to edit or create a ModifierSet object.
-

    Args:
        _window_: A modifier object for apertures with an Outdoors boundary
            condition and a Wall face type for their parent face. This can also
            be text for the identifier of the modifier within the library.
        _skylight_: A modifier object for apertures with an Outdoors boundary
            condition and a RoofCeiling or Floor face type for their parent face.
            This can also be text for the identifier of the modifier within
            the library.
        _operable_: A modifier object for apertures with an Outdoors boundary
            condition and True is_operable property. This can also be text for
            the identifier of the modifier within the library.
        _exterior_door_: A modifier object for opaque doors with an Outdoors
            boundary condition and a Wall face type for their parent face. This
            can also be text for the identifier of the modifier within
            the library.
        _overhead_door_: A modifier object for opaque doors with an Outdoors
            boundary condition and a RoofCeiling or Floor face type for their
            parent face. This can also be text for the identifier of the modifier
            within the library.
        _glass_door_: A modifier object for all glass doors with an Outdoors
            boundary condition. This can also be text for the identifier of the
            modifier within the library.
    
    Returns:
        subface_set: A list of exterior subface modifiers that can be used
            to edit or create a ModifierSet object.
