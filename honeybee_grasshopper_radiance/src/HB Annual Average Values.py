"""
Get average illuminance or irradiance values over an annual daylight or irradiance
simulation.
_
The _hoys_ input can also be used to filter the data for a particular time period or
hour/timestep of the simulation.

-
    Args:
        _results: An list of annual Radiance result files from either the "HB Annual Daylight"
            or the "HB Annual Irradiance" component (containing the .ill files and
            the sun-up-hours.txt). This can also be just the path to the folder
            containing these result files.
        _hoys_: An optional numbers or list of numbers to select the hours of the year (HOYs)
            for which results will be computed. These HOYs can be obtained from the
            "LB Calculate HOY" or the "LB Analysis Period" components. If None, all
            hours of the results will be used.
        grid_filter_: The name of a grid or a pattern to filter the grids. For instance,
            first_floor_* will simulate only the sensor grids that have an
            identifier that starts with first_floor_. By default all the grids
            will be processed.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        values: Average illuminance or irradiance valules for each sensor in lux or W/m2.
            Each value is for a different sensor of the grid. These can be plugged
            into the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component along with meshes of the sensor
            grids to visualize results.
