"""
Get Radiance Sensor Grids and/or Views from a Honeybee Model and visualize them
in the Rhino scene.
-

    Args:
        _model: A Honeybee Model for which grids and views will be output.

    Returns:
        views: A list of Honeybee-Radiance Views that are assigned to the
            input _model.
        grids: A list of Honeybee-Radiance SensorGrids that are assigned to
            the input _model.
        points: The points that are at the center of each grid cell.
        meshes: Mesh for each sensor grid, which can be passed to the "LB Spatial
            Heatmap" component.
