"""
Generate SensorGrids of radial directions around positions from the floors of rooms.
_
This type of sensor grid is particularly helpful for studies of multiple view
directions, such as imageless glare studies.
_
The names of the grids will be the same as the rooms that they came from.
-

    Args:
        _rooms: A list of honeybee Rooms for which sensor grids will be generated.
            This can also be an entire Honeybee Model from which Rooms will
            be extracted.
        _grid_size: Number for the size of the grid cells.
        _dist_floor_: Number for the distance to move points from the floors of
            the input rooms. (Default: 1.2 meters).
        _dir_count_: A positive integer for the number of radial directions to be
            generated around each position. (Default: 8).
        _start_vec_: A Vector3D to set the start direction of the generated directions.
            This can be used to orient the resulting sensors to specific parts
            of the scene. It can also change the elevation of the resulting
            directions since this start vector will always be rotated in the
            XY plane to generate the resulting directions. (Default: (0, -1, 0)).
        wall_offset_: A number for the distance at which sensors close to walls
            should be removed.
        by_zone_: Set to "True" to have the component generate one sensor grid per zone
            across the input rooms rather than one sensor grid per room. This
            option is useful for getting a more consolidated set of Radiance
            results by zone. (Default: False).

    Returns:
        grid: A SensorGrid object that can be used in a grid-based recipe.
        points: The points that are at the center of each circle. These align with
            the vecs output below and can be visualized with the native
            Grasshopper vector display component.
        vecs: The vectors for the directions of each sensor. These align with
            the points output above and can be visualized with the native
            Grasshopper vector display component.
        mesh: Analysis mesh that can be passed to the 'Spatial Heatmap' component.
