"""
Run a daylight factor study for a Honeybee model.

-
    Args:
        _model: A Honeybee Model for which Daylight Factor will be simulated.
            Note that this model should have grids assigned to it in order
            to produce meaningfule results.
        grid_filter_: Text for a grid identifer or a pattern to filter the sensor grids of
            the model that are simulated. For instance, first_floor_* will simulate
            only the sensor grids that have an identifier that starts with
            first_floor_. By default, all grids in the model will be simulated.
        sensor_count_: Integer for the maximum number of sensor grid points per
            parallel execution. (Default: 200).
        radiance_par_: Text for the radiance parameters to be used for ray
            tracing. (Default: -ab 2 -aa 0.1 -ad 2048 -ar 64).
        run_settings_: Settings from the "HB Recipe Settings" component that specify
            how the recipe should be run. This can also be a text string of
            recipe settings.
        _run: Set to True to run the recipe and get results.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        results: The daylight factor values from the simulation.
