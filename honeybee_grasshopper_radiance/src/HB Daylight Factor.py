"""
Run a daylight factor study for a Honeybee model.
_
Daylight Factor (DF) is defined as the ratio of the indoor daylight illuminance
to outdoor illuminance under an unobstructed overcast sky. It is expressed as a
percentage between 0 and 100.
_
Because daylight factor is computed using an overcast sky, it does not change
with [North, East, South, West] orientation. As such, it is more suited to
assessing daylight in climates where cloudy conditions are common. The "HB
Annual Daylight" recipe yields a much more accurate assessment of daylight
and is suitable for all climates, though it requires a significantly longer
calculation time than Daylight Factor.

-
    Args:
        _model: A Honeybee Model for which Daylight Factor will be simulated.
            Note that this model should have grids assigned to it in order
            to produce meaningfule results.
        grid_filter_: Text for a grid identifer or a pattern to filter the sensor grids of
            the model that are simulated. For instance, `first_floor_*` will simulate
            only the sensor grids that have an identifier that starts with
            `first_floor_`. By default, all grids in the model will be simulated.
        radiance_par_: Text for the radiance parameters to be used for ray
            tracing. (Default: -ab 2 -aa 0.1 -ad 2048 -ar 64).
        run_settings_: Settings from the "HB Recipe Settings" component that specify
            how the recipe should be run. This can also be a text string of
            recipe settings.
        _run: Set to True to run the recipe and get results. This input can also be
            the integer "2" to run the recipe silently.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        results: The daylight factor values from the simulation in percent. Each
            value is for a different sensor of the grid. These can be plugged
            into the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component along with meshes of the
            sensor grids to visualize results.
