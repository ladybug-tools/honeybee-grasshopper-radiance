            and simulation assets like Sensor Grids and Views.
        _folder_: An optional folder to into which the Model Radiance Folder
            will be written. NOTE THAT DIRECTORIES INPUT HERE SHOULD NOT HAVE
            ANY SPACES OR UNDERSCORES IN THE FILE PATH.
        _write: Set to True to write the Model to a Radiance folder.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        folder: Path to the folder in which all of the files have been written.
