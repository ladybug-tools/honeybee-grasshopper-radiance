"""
Write a Honeybee Model to a Radiance Model Folder.
_
This Radiance Model Folder is what is used to run various types of Radiance
studies off of a consistent set of geometry and modifiers.

-

    Args:
        _model: A honeybee model object possessing all geometry, radiance modifiers
            and simulation assets like Sensor Grids and Views.
        minimal_: Boolean to note whether the radiance strings should be written in a minimal
            format (with spaces instead of line breaks). (Default: False).
        _folder_: Path to a folder to into which the Model Radiance Folder will be
            written. If unspecified, it will be written to a sub-folder
            within the default simulation folder.
        _write: Set to True to write the Model to a Radiance folder.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        folder: Path to the folder in which all of the files have been written.
