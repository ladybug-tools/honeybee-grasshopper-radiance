"""
Generate SensorGrid objects from the floors of honeybee Rooms.
These SensorGrids can be used in a grid-based recipe.
-
The names of the grids will be the same as the rooms that they came from.
-

    Args:
        _rooms: A list of honeybee Rooms for which sensor grids will be generated.
            This can also be an entire Honeybee Model from which Rooms will
            be extracted.
        _grid_size: Number for the size of the grid cells.
        _dist_floor_: Number for the distance to move points from the floors of
            the input rooms. The default is 0.8 meters.
        quad_only_: Boolean to note whether meshing should be done using Rhino's
            defaults (False), which fills the entire _geometry to the edges
            with both quad and tringulated faces, or a mesh with only quad
            faces should be generated.
            _
            FOR ADVANCED USERS: This input can also be a vector object that will
            be used to set the orientation of the quad-only grid. Note that,
            if a vector is input here that is not aligned with the plane of
            the room's floors, an error will be raised.
        remove_out_: Boolean to note whether an extra check should be run to remove
            sensor points that lie outside the Room volume. Note that this can
            add significantly to the component's run time and this check is
            usually not necessary in the case that all walls are vertical
            and all floors are horizontal (Default: False).

    Returns:
        grid: A SensorGrid object that can be used in a grid-based recipe.
        points: The points that are at the center of each grid cell.
        mesh: Analysis mesh that can be passed to the 'Color Mesh' component.
