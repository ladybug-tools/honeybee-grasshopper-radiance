"""
Create a Sensor Grid object that can be used in a grid-based recipe.
-

    Args:
        _name_: A name for this sensor grid.
        _positions: A list or a datatree of points with one point for the position
            of each sensor. Each branch of the datatree will be considered as a
            separate sensor grid.
        _directions_: A list or a datatree of vectors with one vector for the
            direction of each sensor. The input here MUST therefor align with
            the input _positions. If no value is provided (0, 0, 1) will be
            assigned for all the sensors.
        mesh_: An optional mesh that aligns with the sensors. This is useful for
            generating visualizations of the sensor grid beyond the sensor
            positions. Note that the number of sensors in the grid must match
            the number of faces or the number vertices within the mesh.
        base_geo_: An optional Brep for the geometry used to make the grid. There are
            no restrictions on how this brep relates to the sensors and it is
            provided only to assist with the display of the grid when the number
            of sensors or the mesh is too large to be practically visualized.

    Returns:
        grid: An SensorGrid object that can be used in a grid-based recipe.
