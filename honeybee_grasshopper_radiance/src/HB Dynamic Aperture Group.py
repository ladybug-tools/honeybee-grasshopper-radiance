"""
Combine Honeybee Apertures into a single dynamic group. Apertures that are a part
of the same dynamic group will have their states change in unison. If an aperture
has no dynamic group, it is assumed to be static.
-
This component can also be used to combine apertures that already have states
assigned to them into one group since existing states are not overwritten if
nothing is connected to states_. In this case, the total number of states in
the dynamic group is equal to that of the object with the highest number of
states. After a dynamic aperture with fewer states than that of it's dynamic
group has hit its highest state, it remains in that state as the other dynamic
apertures continue to change.
-

    Args:
        _apertures: A list of Honeybee Apertures to be grouped together into a
            single dynamic group. Door objects can also be connected here to be
            included in the group.
        _name_: Text to be incorporated into a unique identifier for the dynamic
            Aperture group. If the name is not provided, a random name will be assigned.
        states_: An optional list of Honeybee State objects ordered based on
            how they will be switched on. The first state is the default state
            and, typically, higher states are more shaded. If the objects in the
            group have no states, the modifiers already assigned the apertures
            will be used for all states.
    
    Returns:
        group_aps: Honeybee apertures that are a part of the same dynamic group.
            These can be used directly in radiance simulations or can be added
            to Honeybee faces and rooms.
