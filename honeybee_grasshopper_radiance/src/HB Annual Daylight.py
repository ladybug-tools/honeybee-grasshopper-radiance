"""
Run an annual daylight study for a single model.

    Args:
        _model: A Honeybee Model for which Annual Daylight will be simulated.
            Note that this model should have grids assigned to it in order
            to produce meaningfule results.
        _wea: A Honeybee-Radiance Wea object produced from the Wea components
            that are under the the Light Sources tab.
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise difference
            between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees. This can
            also be Vector for the direction to North. (Default: 0).
        grid_filter_: Text for a grid identifer or a pattern to filter the sensor grids of
            the model that are simulated. For instance, first_floor_* will simulate
            only the sensor grids that have an identifier that starts with
            first_floor_. By default, all grids in the model will be simulated.
        sensor_count_: Integer for the maximum number of sensor grid points per
            parallel execution. (Default: 200).
        radiance_par_: Text for the radiance parameters to be used for ray
            tracing. (Default: -ab 2 -ad 5000 -lw 2e-05).

    Returns:
        recipe: A simulation recipe that contains a simulation instructions and
            input arguments. Use the "HB Run Recipe" component to execute the
            recipe and get results.
