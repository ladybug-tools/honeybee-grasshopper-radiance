"""
Create a Wea object from an EPW file.
-

    Args:
        _epw_file: Full path to an .epw weather file.
        hoys_: An optional list of hours of the year (numbers from 0 to 8759) for
            which the Wea will be filtered. HOYs can be generated from the
            "LB Analysis Period" component or they can be obtained through
            other means like analysis of the values in an occupancy schedule.
            By default, the Wea will be generated for the whole year.
        timestep_: An integer representing the timestep with which to make the 
            WEA object.  Default is set to 1 for 1 step per hour of the year.

    Returns:
        wea: A wea object from epw file.
