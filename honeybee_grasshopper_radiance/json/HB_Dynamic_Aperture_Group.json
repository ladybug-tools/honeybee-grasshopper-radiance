If an aperture\nhas no dynamic group, it is assumed to be static.\n-\nThis component can also be used to combine apertures that already have states\nassigned to them into one group since existing states are not overwritten if\nnothing is connected to states_. In this case, the total number of states in\nthe dynamic group is equal to that of the object with the highest number of\nstates.
