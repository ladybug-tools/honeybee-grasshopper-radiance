  "description": "Generate electric lighting schedules from annual daylight results, which can be\nused to account for daylight controls in energy simulations.\n_\nSuch controls will dim the lights in the energy simulation according to whether\nthe illuminance values at the sensor locations are at a target illuminance setpoint.\n_\nIn addition to benefiting from the accuracy of Radiance, using this component has\nseveral advantages over the \"HB Apply Daylight Control\" component under HB-Energy.\nNotably, it can account for setups with multiple illuminance sensors.\n_\nThis component will generate one schedule per sensor grid in the simulation. Each\ngrid should have sensors at the locations in space where daylight dimming sensors\nare located. Grids with one, two, or more sensors can be used to model setups\nwhere fractions of each room are controlled by different sensors. If the sensor\ngrids are distributed over the entire floor of the rooms, the resulting schedules\nwill be idealized, where light dimming has been optimized to supply the minimum\nilluminance setpoint everywhere in the room.\n-"
