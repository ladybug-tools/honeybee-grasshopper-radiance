  "description": "Calculate Aperture groups for exterior Apertures.\n_\nThe Apertures are grouped by orientation unless _view_factor_ is set to True.\n_\nIf grouping based on view factor the component calculates view factor from\nApertures to sky patches (rfluxmtx). Each Aperture is represented by a sensor\ngrid, and the view factor for the whole Aperture is the average of the grid. The\nRMSE of the view factor to each sky patch is calculated between all Apertures.\nAgglomerative hierarchical clustering (with complete-linkage method) is used to\ngroup the Apertures by using a distance matrix of the RMSE values.\nThe view factor approach is Radiance-based (and slower) and will likely group\nApertures more accurately considering the context geometry of the Honeybee\nModel.\n-"
