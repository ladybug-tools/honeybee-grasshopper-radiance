  "description": "Apply a section plane to a Honeybee Radiance View.\n_\nThe plane will always be perpendicular to the view direction for perspective\nand parallel view types. For fisheye view types, the clipping plane is actually\na clipping sphere, centered on the view point.\n_\nObjects in front of this imaginary plane will not be visible. This may be useful\nfor seeing through walls (to get a longer perspective from an exterior view point)\nor for incremental rendering.\n-"
