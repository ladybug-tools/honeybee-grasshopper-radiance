  "description": "Calculate Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) from lists of daylight autonomy values.\n_\nAs per IES-LM-83-12 Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) is a metric describing\nannual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments.\nIt is defined as the percent of an analysis area (the area where calcuations\nare performed -typically across an entire space) that meets a minimum\ndaylight illuminance level for a specified fraction of the operating hours\nper year. The sDA value is expressed as a percentage of area.\n_\nNote: This component will only output a LEED compliant sDA if you've run the\nsimulation with dynamic blinds and blind schedules as per the IES-LM-83-12\nstandard. If you are not using dynamic blinds, then this output is NOT LEED\ncompliant.\n-"
